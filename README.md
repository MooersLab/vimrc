# vimrc
Blaine's current .vimrc file for his Macbook Pro.

This vimrc file is for my current VIM setup: VIM - Vi IMproved 8.2 (2019 Dec 12, compiled Aug 15 2021 13:04:41). 
I am using a version compiled with home brew.
I am using the Vim-Plug manager after several years of using Vundle.

I use Vim-Plug because it also runs on neovim.
The same plugin often works in both editors, but that is changing as the two editors diverge.

My main uses of Vim are for editing LaTeX files and script files, including the use of snippets for both.
I also often have to edit scripts on remote machines and Vim is very useful for this task.
However, my local version of Vim is often ahead of the versions on the remote computers, hence the need to form a repo for the vimrc file for .
