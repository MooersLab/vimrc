# vimrc
Blaine's current .vimrc file for his Macbook Pro.

This vimrc file is for my current VIM setup: VIM - Vi IMproved 8.2 (2019 Dec 12, compiled Aug 15 2021 13:04:41). 
I am using a version compiled with home brew.
I am using the Vim-Plug manager after several years of using Vundle.
I use Vim-Plug because it also runs on neovim.
The same plugin often works in both editors, but that is changing as the two editors diverge.

My main uses of Vim are for editing LaTeX files and script files, including the use of snippets for both.
I also often have to edit scripts on remote machines and Vim is very useful for this task.
However, my local version of Vim is often ahead of the versions on the remote computers, hence the need to form a repo for the vimrc file for .

The first rule to keep in mind with modal editing in Vim is that you want to be in the normal mode most of the time.
It is in this mode that most of the editing and nvaigation commands operate.
Consider the normal mode to be the reference state.
You occassionally enter the insert mode to add text, but then you pop out of the insert mode back to the normal mode as soon as you finish making the insertion.

The second major idea is composability of the vim commands.
You can combine commands into compound comands.
This reduces the number of independent operatoins and saves time.

Many other text editors allow you to use the Vim key bindings so you are not limited to using them in the Vim application.
You can even use Vim in Emacs!
